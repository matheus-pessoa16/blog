Artificial Intelligence is the study of techniques that can create intelligent machines. These machines can learn from data how to react to various activities. This computer science field has been developed since 50's but just recently reached a big important level as result of more data, fast computers and better data storage.
Machine Learning (ML) is a subset of AI, that use algorithms, linear algebra and statistics to learn from data. There are three principal categories of learning in ML
* Supervised learning
  * Takes labeled data to create a model that can make predictions about new data. The prediction can be a **classification** when we have classes or categories for the data (given a picture of a animal, predict which animal it is) or can be be a **regression** when we want to predict a future value (like stock prices). 
* Unsupervised learning
  * Takes not labeled data and try to find hidden patterns. **Dimensionality reduction** and **clustering** are two types of unsupervised learning. The first compress data by removing variables less meaningful of the dataset. This makes data easier to visualize, run computations and store. Clustering is about grouping similar data and create a separation between the groups to create structures.
* Reinforcement learning
  * RL uses a trial-and-error with a reward system to teach the an agent. The agent can execute good actions and receive a reward or bad actions and receive punishments.

After this quick review of the types of learning techniques used in ML, lets discuss about Deep Learning, a subset of Machine Learning (yeah, I know that is weird, but this is something that happens when a subset has too much things inside, we subdivide it again).
Deep Learning utilizes Neural Networks, a technique that imitates the human brain using artificial neurons layered. Each layer is connected to the next layer and the connections have weights that represents its importance. Deep learning is a reference to the number of layers also called depth.

Neural Networks is a supervised learning technique wich means that we must provide labeled data to train the algorithm to predict something. The data is passed through the network and each weight are updated to reduce the error of the prediction in the training step. The weights are updated using the backpropagation that uses the prediction error to calculate the new weight value.

Deep Learning is one of the most prominent field of the Machine Learning/AI. There are a lot of applications in many areas such as autonomous driving, speech recognition, image recognition and segmentation etc. Machine Learning techniques are used a lot too in data science, data analysis and even in some of deep learn task, when we don't have a really powerful machine and a big dataset (even whether the results are not so good). 

Data are the new oil and AI is the tool to extract it.
